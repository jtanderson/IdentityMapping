    We are asking you to participate in this activity because you are currently
    a student at Salisbury University.
    <h2>Participation, Survey Duration, Research Procedures</h2>

    If you are under the age of 18, you are not able to participate in this
    activity and your information will not be used. Survey Duration. The survey
    activity will take place once during the semester, and the session will take
    30 to 60 minutes to complete.
    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    The activity will involve creating a social identity map and completing a
    battery of survey questions about cognitive, emotional, attitudinal, and
    behavioral characteristics as they pertain to you.
    <h2>Risks and Benefits of Participation, Participant Risk</h2>
    There is a risk of time investment in completing survey. However, the time
    investment is minimal and not likely to impose any hardship. Participant
    Benefits. Students who volunteer to participate in completing the activity
    mapping process and questionnaires will be offered extra credit. Students
    who want to receive extra-credit, but do not wish to participate in the
    mapping process and questionnaires portion of the activity will be offered
    an alternative writing activity with a comparable time component to
    complete. Students will receive extra credit for completion of the session.
    Participating students will receive benefits of extra-credit, improved
    awareness of their social identities inter-relationships, and insights into
    their own attitudes and knowledge of factors that may be associated with
    their social identities. Participating students also may increase their
    self-awareness of the role their social identities play in their lives.

        Alternative Options for extra credit
    </h2>
    You may complete an alternate writing assignment for the extra-credit. The
    writing assignment will have a comparable time commitment. This alternate
    writing assignment will involve writing about the nature of how one or more
    of your social identities relate to your learning of the course material in
    your current course. Protection of Anonymity and Confidentiality. There will
    be sessions held in a computer lab during which you will participate in this
    activity. You will need to sign a paper form (with the last 4 digits of your
    SU ID) to verify your participation in the activity. This paper form will
    not be associated with your responses in any way. You may leave any item on
    the questionnaires blank if you so choose. Data Use/Data anonymity &
    confidentiality Protection. The PI and Co-PI’s will minimize risks to your
    responses by storing all information on a secure, password-protected
    computer on Herokup.com’s secure server and on a password-protected computer
    on Salisbury University’s secure server. No identifying information will be
    included. Members of the research team will have access to the anonymous
    responses provided to evaluate the usability of the mapping software and to
    evaluate potential strategies for analyzing the responses.
