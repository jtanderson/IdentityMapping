# Identity Mapping

Here Will be the updated List of things to do:
  - [ ] Implement the new layering/rendering logic, across both phases of the survey
    - [x] Test done item
  - [ ] Clean up the codebase, removing old code, comments, and files. Add new documentation as much as possible. Now that all changes will be tracked by git, we can remove/change things frequently without too much risk, as weâ€™ll be able to revert.
  - [ ] Begin the logic of persisting the survey data into a database, to be later linked to a database server that we set up on AWS
