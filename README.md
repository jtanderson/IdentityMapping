# Identity Mapping

    6/19 Meeting:
    Below are current bugs:
  - [ ] (CYRRENT BUG) Need to layer the three four and five intersections (i.e a three tuple intersection should be on top of a two tuple intersection)
  - [ ] (CURRENT BUG) Intersections color disappear after de selecting and trying to recolor another intersection
  - [ ] (CURRENT BUG) Intersection of three, four, five tuple not rendering properly. Layering issue, they are there just under two tuples
  - [ ] (CURRENT BUG) object outlines (solid, dotted) cannot make two dotted in a row since already selected on screen
  - [ ] Add graces new changes to new version of code
  - [x] Revert to older version of code
  - [ ] Add debug mode for turning logs on or off??
  - [x] Remove any old code or comments from the layering file
  - [ ] Try to put as much info into a database like log/ local storage
  - [x] organize the code
