# Identity Mapping

## Current TODO

### 2/11 Meeting:
  - [ ] Intersection survey table migration made

  - [ ] Double check web routes (are all surveys in there?)

### 2/25 Meeting:
  - [ ] Only allow ages 18+ in dropdowns
  - [ ] On the positioning page, when one circle is completely inside another (paperjs has a test for this), if they click that circle, make the click attach to the circle, not the intersection (outsibe-in)
    - Low prioity for now
    - As a shim, add text to the user in the instructions to mention this awkward case
  - [ ] Survey for how the user feels about the interface
